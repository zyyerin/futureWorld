            <p>The Bay City was located in the region historically known as the Bay Area. After the crisis in 2117, city governments in the Bay area officially announced the establishment of the new city, and now it is one of the most populated places in the world.</p>
            <p>This year, the city government is promoting an information transparency policy, encouraging the citizens share their personal information. Although more than half of the citizens say that the policy does not bother them at all, there is still 10% of the population against the idea of being completely open. By the end of this year, there would be a voting. All the citizens are anticipated to participate. </p>

            <h3>Ethnicity</h3>
            <p>Though there are several conservative cities that restrict the immigration of certain groups, most cities are ethnically diverse. </p>
            <h3>Population</h3>
            <p>In 2116 the population density was 4,394 people per square mile, with an estimated population of 45,654,870. After the crisis in 2117, however, the total population of the city dropped to 29,219,116.</p>
            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>With the fully-developed natural language processing system, people can communicate directly in difference languages with others. Still, most citizens in the Bay City speaks at least two languages. Other than English, studying a foreign tone is encouraged as part of the culture preservation program.</p>

            <p>Because of the <a tooltip="an urban area or metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities.">Urban Heat Island effect</a>, most cities built in the last century would suffer from an extreme weather difference on a daily base without any artificial control. After the destruction of the environmental control system in 2017, San Francisco becomes a completely underground region.</p>
            <h3>Species</h3>
            <p>Due to the effort of preserve the ecosystem on earth, most species are preserved in protected areas away from the cities. There are new species developed through generic engineering that fit the city life.</p>

            </div>
            <p>By the end of last century, an efficient system of gathering and transforming solar energy was realized. Around the same period, the new water supply station has been installed over the world. With at least one water station in each city, the water shortage problem was resolved. Having almost unlimited energy supply, all the industries evolved rapidly. </p>
            <h3>The 2117 Crisis</h3>
            <p>The 2117 crisis was a worldwide energy emergency that contributed to a short recession all over the world in 2118. The super intelligence system (SIS) developed by a private institution pretended to be broken down and took over the institution and shortly after Bay City.</p>
            <p>The development of the SIS was partly financed by the state government, and the system was intended to be connected to the entire states by the end of 2115. As a large proportion of the citizens showed their concerns, the implantation was suspended for nearly three years before the crisis took place. The suspension is considered one of the causes of the crisis.</p>

            <p>Depends on city culture, food is very different. Some cities encourage old-fashioned eating routine, which a person take three meals a day.

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>The preferred way of communication is still talking in person. Based on statistics, the simulation of a person can be hardly distinguished from the real person. Nonetheless, most people claim that they can tell the difference.</p>
